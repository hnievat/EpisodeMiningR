# EpisodeMiningR
WINEPI Episode Mining algorithm for R
Original algorithm by Mannila, et al. 1997
Based on the Python implementation by @duytri and @nkmrtty

Uses libraries gtools and rapportools
Tested on RStudio 1.4.1717, R 4.1.1, gtools 3.9.2, and rapportools 1.0

## Features
- Program flow as similar to the original as possible, with a few changes
- Features both serial and parallel episode making

## Issues
- Few sanity checks, must make sure data is in the right format

## To do
- Implement WINEPI
- Optimize code and data structure
